## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Initial project structure with modular components
- Core database module for vector storage
- Document processing pipeline
- Web interface with Flask
- Configuration management system
- Project documentation (context and rules)

### Changed
- Reorganized codebase into modular structure
- Updated import statements to use absolute imports
- Separated document processing from core functionality

### Architecture Decisions
1. **Modular Structure** (2024-04-01)
   - Decided to split the application into four main modules:
     - Database operations
     - Document processing
     - Configuration management
     - Web interface
   - Rationale: Better separation of concerns and maintainability

2. **Import Strategy** (2024-04-01)
   - Switched to absolute imports within the package
   - Rationale: Clearer dependency management and better IDE support

3. **Document Processing Independence** (2024-04-01)
   - Separated document processing from core functionality
   - Rationale: Allows for independent development and testing of processing components

4. **Security Implementation** (2024-04-01)
   - Implemented encryption for sensitive data in database
   - Added secure file handling guidelines
   - Rationale: Enhanced security for personal document management

### Technical Decisions
1. **Database Design** (2024-04-01)
   - Chose PostgreSQL with pgvector for vector storage
   - Implemented encrypted columns for sensitive data
   - Rationale: Robust vector search capabilities with security

2. **Document Processing** (2024-04-01)
   - Implemented modular document processors
   - Added support for multiple document types
   - Rationale: Flexible and extensible processing pipeline

3. **Configuration Management** (2024-04-01)
   - Centralized configuration in dedicated module
   - Implemented metadata templates
   - Rationale: Consistent configuration across components

### Future Considerations
1. **Performance Optimization**
   - Consider caching strategies
   - Optimize vector search
   - Implement batch processing

2. **Security Enhancements**
   - Add user authentication
   - Implement role-based access control
   - Add audit logging

3. **Documentation**
   - Add API documentation
   - Create user guides
   - Document deployment procedures

## [0.1.0] - 2024-04-01
